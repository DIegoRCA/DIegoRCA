### Hi, Iâ€™m Diego ðŸ‘‹!
In my university days, I started coding (HTML, CSS & JS) at the same time as designing and printing, life and work led me to specialize in graphic design and printing. 
<br />In that space I have achieved a high level of expertise, with practices and standards for customer, suppliers and staff management. During the last  2 years of  the pandemic, my passion for coding was awakened again, and I realized I would like to return to my initial path  so I began to prepare myself for a change.
<br />Both, I prepared myself mentally and academically, through a lot of hours and nights of practice. 
I am ready now to take my next opportunity to bring my experience and learn, adding value to projects and growing as a professional developer.

ðŸ”§ **Things I work with:**
